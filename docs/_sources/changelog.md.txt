# Changelog

## 0.5.0 - 2026-05-13

### Summary

nvMolKit 0.5.0 adds three new GPU-accelerated APIs: Torsion Fingerprint Deviation (TFD), pairwise conformer RMSD, and UFF force field optimization. It also introduces a `BatchedForcefield` Python API for MMFF and UFF with constraints, custom options, and multi-conformer minimization; a low-memory fused Butina clustering path that avoids the O(N²) distance matrix; a Python autotuning framework for the main APIs; and optional device-side output for ETKDG and forcefield optimization. Blackwell / L-class GPUs (including sm_103/B300) are now supported, the supported RDKit range is now 2025.03.1 through 2026.03.1, and nvMolKit is available via `pip install nvmolkit`.

### Features
- GPU-accelerated Torsion Fingerprint Deviation (TFD) for batch all-pairs conformer comparison ([#71](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/71))
- GPU-accelerated pairwise conformer RMSD matrix computation by @volgin
- GPU-accelerated UFF force field, supporting all options that the new `BatchedForcefield` Python API provides for MMFF ([#114](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/114))
- New `BatchedForcefield` Python API exposing per-molecule control over forcefield minimization (MMFF or UFF), and through it custom MMFF optimization options (max iterations, energy/gradient tolerances, non-bonded cutoff) ([#70](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/70))
- Distance and position constraints on forcefield optimization (MMFF and UFF) ([#26](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/26))
- Multi-conformer minimization in the `BatchedForcefield` API
- `HardwareOptions` support for MMFF minimization, matching the ETKDG hardware-targeting API
- Device-side output for ETKDG and forcefield optimization, allowing GPU tensors to flow between nvMolKit calls without round-tripping through host memory ([#140](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/140))
- Python autotuning library for the main APIs (`nvmolkit.autotune`), including ETKDG, forcefield optimization, and substructure search, with configuration serialization ([#141](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/141))
- Low-memory fused Butina clustering that computes Tanimoto similarities on the fly with Triton-backed kernels, avoiding the O(N²) distance matrix and enabling clustering of larger fingerprint datasets on a single GPU ([#110](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/110))
- Support for Blackwell and L-class GPUs, including sm_103 SASS for B300

### Bug Fixes
- Fix latent stream-ordering bug in the MMFF/BFGS minimizer that could race with subsequent operations ([#172](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/172))
- Fix `int32` overflow in substructure pair indexing for batches where `numTargets * numQueries` exceeds `INT32_MAX`, which previously caused out-of-bounds writes in `hasSubstructMatch` and `countSubstructMatches` ([#169](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/169))
- Fix shared-memory overflow in the substructure recursive preprocessor caused by an incorrect config setting ([#98](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/98))
- Fix empty result handling in substructure search with `uniquify` when all matches were already unique ([#112](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/112))

### Miscellaneous
- pip wheel distribution pipeline (`pip install nvmolkit`) with manylinux_2_28 wheels for CPython 3.11-3.14 ([#15](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/15))
- RDKit support range is now 2025.03.1 through 2026.03.1
- Validate `batchesPerGpu` in `HardwareOptions` so every consumer gets a clean `ValueError` instead of a cryptic C++ error from the MMFF / ETKDG layer ([#103](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/103))
- Validate `neighborlist_max_size` in `butina()` before reaching the GPU ([#104](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/104))
- Validate MMFF atom types up front and report every failing molecule instead of hitting a `PRECONDITION` assertion mid-batch ([#106](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/106))

## 0.4.0 - 2026-02-23

### Summary

nvMolKit 0.4.0 adds GPU-accelerated substructure searching, optional stream control across Python APIs, and enhancements to Butina clustering.

### Contributors
- Kevin Boyd (@scal444)
- Eva Xue (@evasnow1992)

### Features
- GPU-accelerated substructure search with `hasSubstructMatch`, `countSubstructMatches`, and `getSubstructMatches`. Supports batch queries against batch targets with SMARTS-based query molecules.
- Optional `stream` parameter added to fingerprint generation, similarity, and Butina clustering APIs, enabling explicit CUDA stream control
- Butina clustering now supports optional centroid reporting via the `return_centroids` parameter ([#82](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/82))
- Butina clustering performance improved by replacing CPU loops with CUDA Graph conditional nodes ([#72](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/72))

### Bug Fixes
- Fix data races when torch operations immediately followed nvMolKit calls on the default stream (Issue [#84](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/84)). Operations now correctly use the current stream or an explicit `stream` parameter ([#36](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/issues/36)).
- Fix `setup.py` compatibility on some Python versions and rework CUDA target detection ([#68](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Digital-Bio/nvMolKit/pull/68))
